# üíé Page Prism

## Introduction

Page Prism is a web application designed to help designers and developers collect and organize visual inspirations for their projects.

Inspirations are content pulled from an existing webpage that has certain features that inspire the project.

### Key Features

- Create and manage design inspiration projects
- Capture screenshots of websites and save them as `inspirations`
- Organize inspirations within projects
- View and edit project and inspiration details

## Dependencies

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- CSS Modules
- React Router
- IndexedDB (via idb library)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

1. **Node.js** (version 18.20.2)

   - Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Verify installation: `node --version`

2. **npm** (usually comes with Node.js)

   - Verify installation: `npm --version`

3. **Docker**
   - Download and install from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/)
   - Verify installation: `docker --version`

### Page Prism Web app setup

1. Clone this repository or download the the code as a zip.

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` to view the application.

5. Run tests:

   ```
   npm test
   ```

   This will run all the tests in the project using Jest.
